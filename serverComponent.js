In Next.js 15, a relatively uncommon error arises when using server components with a complex data fetching setup.  The issue manifests as a seemingly random failure to hydrate the client-side components, resulting in an unhandled promise rejection or a blank screen.  This is often exacerbated by asynchronous operations within the server component or when dealing with large datasets fetched from external APIs. The root cause is usually a mismatch between the data structure expected by the client-side component and the data actually provided by the server component.  This can involve subtle differences in data types, missing keys, or unexpected null values, making debugging challenging.
