# Next.js 15 Server Component Hydration Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug related to server component hydration in Next.js 15, specifically when dealing with asynchronous data fetching and potential data structure mismatches.  The client-side component fails to hydrate properly, leading to errors or a blank screen. The solution focuses on robust data handling and error checking to prevent these mismatches.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Observe the hydration error in the browser's console.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully checking the data structure and handling potential errors during asynchronous operations.  This includes thorough type checking and error handling within the server component.
